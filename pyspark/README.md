# About

Just a dockerfile I wrote to try out the code of a pyspark course locally.

I followed the installation instructions from the course (tailored for an ubuntu vm) and made a few adjustments where needed.

I will make adjustments to this image as needed to follow the course.

# Usage

Launch the container by running:

```
./run.sh
```

Find out the connection string by typing:

```
docker logs pyspark-jupyter-notebook
```

Plug the connection string in your browser.
