# About

This is a "high availability" local orchestration for Apache Pulsar (yes, **high availability** and **local** are somewhat of an oxymoron, hence the quotes)

This not meant to be used in production. There is an official Helm chart for that: http://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/helm-install/

This is more of a personal exercise to get some hands on practice on how the different components of a Pulsar cluster fit together.
